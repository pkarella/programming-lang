            <h1>Java</h1>
              <p>Among the fastest of the major programming languages used for building web sites, but among the slowest in terms of development time. Java is very strict about code following formal rules and structures, and does not generally provide a lot of shortcuts to reduce boilerplate code, so writing Java code is comparatively time-consuming. Java is a very popular language for programming generally (it generally switches off with C at the top of the rankings), and for web programming in particular. Java is also favored by organizations for which security is a very high priority (e.g. financial institutions). Java engineers tend to command a premium. Java is a natural fit if your priority is extreme application speed or enterprise-grade security; otherwise, it is likely not worth the costs in development time and engineer salary.</p>

            <h1>PHP</h1>
              <p>PHP is a language that was designed specifically for building web sites, and it is traditionally the easiest to deploy (put your site on a host and make it live). PHP is very popular and there are lots of highly competent PHP developers in the world; that said, many experienced engineers tend to stay away from PHP because the language is, to put it mildly, not very elegant. PHP may be a good fit for very simple sites; very constrained budgets (developers can generally be found for a bargain); or sites that are a good fit for existing PHP frameworks (Wordpress, Drupal, etc.</p>

          <div id="ruby">
            <h1>Ruby</h1>
              <p>The stated aim of Ruby's designer was to create a language to make programmers happy, and it has done so successfully enough to gain a large following. While Ruby is a general-purpose language, its use skews toward web development, thanks to the popular Rails framework, which allows developers to focus on the specific features their application needs while providing out-of-the-box functionality that any web application would need. Ruby has a large and well-organized corpus of libraries for just about any need; Ruby libraries tend to focus on being as easy to use and understand as possible. Ruby is a particularly good fit for first-time programmers, but should also join Python on your short list of default choices. [Full disclosure: I am primarily a Ruby programmer </p>
